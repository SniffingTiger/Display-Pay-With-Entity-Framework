# Display-Pay-With-Entity-Framework
This was a class project that demanded I use collections to store employee information and then output the standard, overtime, and total pay for each employee.

Instead, I decided to use Entity Framework to do this. The connection string here references my LocalDB, so if you fork this repo it will not work for you unless you make your own LocalDB using Entity Framework Code-First.
